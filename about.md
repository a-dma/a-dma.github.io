I am currently employed as a Software Engineer at [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I work on strong multi-factor authentication (U2F, OpenPGP, PIV).

In 2014 I received a PhD degree in Computer Science from the [Embedded System Engineering](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/ESE){:target="_blank"} section of the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english){:target="_blank"}. My research focus was on Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks, with particular attention to Security.
