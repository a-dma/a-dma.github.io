I am currently employed as a Software Engineer at Yubico, where I work on strong multi-factor authentication (U2F).

In 2014 I received a PhD degree in Computer Science from the Embedded System Engineering section of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark. My research focus was on Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks, with particular attention to Security.
